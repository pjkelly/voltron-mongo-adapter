# voltron-mongo-adapter: A voltron.io Component

voltron-adapter provides mid-level adapters to provide access to
a variety of datastores. These adapters shouldn't be considered at the level
of an ORM, but rather provide a convenient API around more low-level drivers. If
used as part of [voltron.io](https://github.com/jmreiy/voltron.io), adapter methods
decorate a provided [voltron-model](https://github.com/jmreidy/voltron-model) Object,
but the adapters can be used on their own without any other voltron components.

There are currently two adapters: one for
[https://github.com/jmreidy/voltron-pg-adapter](Postgres), and this one for
MongoDB.

## Adapters

The steps for implementing an adapter are the same for all voltron-adapters.

1. `require` the adapter you want to use
2. Call `<Adapter>.configure` to setup the connection to the datastore.
3. Instantiate new Adapters, with the table name (or collection or URL root) and
instance-specific configuration options.

Adapters are built around [Q promises](https://github.com/kriskowal/q), but support
callbacks as well.

## Mongo Adapter
The Mongo adapter provides a wrapper around the [node-mongodb-native](http://mongodb.github.com/node-mongodb-native/)
driver. It is designed to support basic CRUD operations. The API is very limited at this time.

### Constructor
The Adapter constructor takes the following arguments `(collectionName, options)`:

`collection`: The name of the collection for this adapter instance.
`options.modelConstructor`: The constructor function to call for instantiating query results.
`options.primaryKey`: The name of the `id` field for the collection.

### Configure
`MongoAdapter.configure` takes the following arguments:

`connectionOptions`: A hash of connection options to be used when establishing the connection with the database. 
* `url`: for establishing a connection via mongo url, including support for replica sets.  See conventions for the url connection format: [docs](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/driver-articles/mongoclient.html#the-url-connection-format)

or

* `server`: domain where the database lives, e.g. `localhost`
* `port`: e.g. `3000`
* `db`: name of the database to connect to
* `username`: username for connecting to the database, if any
* `password`: password for connecting to the database, if any

`configOptions`: A hash of configuration options to use when for connecting (if necessary). [docs](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/driver-articles/mongoclient.html#mongoclient-connect-options)

### Prototype methods
The following methods are exposed on the adapter:

`findAll(query, [options], [cb])`: Query the adapter's `collectionName` for all documents,
passing the provided query hash and options. See the driver's docs for `collection.find` for details.
Results are instantiated via the adapter's `modelConstructor` and returned as a promise (and passed
to a provided CB).

`findOne(query, [options], [cb])`: Query the adapter's `collectionName` for a single document,
passing the provided query hash and options. See the driver's docs for `collection.findOne` for details.
The result is instantiaed via the adaper's `modelConstructor` and returned as a promise (and passed
to a provided CB).

`remove(id, [cb])`: Removes a document from the adapter's `collectionName`, matching the provided `id`
to the adaper's `primaryKey` as a query hash. Returns a promise.

`save(target, [cb])`: Saves a target document to Mongo. Calls the driver's `insert` or `update` operation,
depending on whether the target document is new. It determines this condition by checking whether
the target document has a value for the adapter's `primaryKey` field; if the value exists, the document
is assumed to have a provisioned ID, and the document and ID are passed to the driver's `update` operation.
If the ID does not exist, the document is passed to `insert`. Insert operations return a promise with the
newly created ID (which is also passed to a CB, if provided); update operations simply return a promise
(and call a provided callback on completion).


### Tests
